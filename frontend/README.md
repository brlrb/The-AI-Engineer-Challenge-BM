# 🤖 AI Engineer Challenge - Frontend

A modern, beautiful chat interface built with Next.js that integrates with the FastAPI backend to provide a seamless experience for chatting with GPT-4.1-mini.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient design with glassmorphism effects
- **Real-time Streaming**: See AI responses as they're being generated
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Password-style input for your OpenAI API key
- **Customizable System Messages**: Define the AI's role and behavior
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Message History**: View your conversation history with timestamps
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to the latest messages

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
2. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
3. **FastAPI Backend** running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Running the Backend

Make sure your FastAPI backend is running before using the frontend:

```bash
# Navigate to the api directory
cd ../api

# Install Python dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
python app.py
```

The backend should be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🎨 Usage

1. **Enter your OpenAI API Key**: 
   - Click the API key input field
   - Enter your OpenAI API key (it's stored locally and never sent to our servers)

2. **Customize the System Message** (optional):
   - Modify the default system message to define how the AI should behave
   - Examples:
     - "You are a helpful coding assistant."
     - "You are a creative writing coach."
     - "You are a math tutor."

3. **Start Chatting**:
   - Type your message in the input field
   - Press Enter or click the 🚀 button
   - Watch the AI response stream in real-time!

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Hooks** - State management and side effects

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory for any environment-specific configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the following FastAPI endpoints:

- `POST /api/chat` - Send chat messages and receive streaming responses
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## 🚀 Deployment

This frontend is designed to be deployed on Vercel. The project includes:

- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- Optimized build settings for production

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to connect your GitHub repository and deploy.

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Streaming Responses
The frontend uses the Fetch API's streaming capabilities to display AI responses in real-time as they're generated by the backend.

### Security
- API keys are stored locally in component state
- No sensitive data is sent to any server except OpenAI
- Password-style input prevents accidental exposure

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Glassmorphism effects for modern aesthetics
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
